# Core-Gene-Pipeline


This is the code repository for Joshua Morrisons PhD thesis titled "Constructing a Streptococcal super-pangenome and characterising the core and essential genes of the Streptococcal genus"


All python scripts were designed to run in a Linux environment. Creating virtual mamba environments for each module is necessary, as otherwise dependency issues will arise.

In chapter 2, we will present the necessary code to run our full pangenome analysis of 6 species of Streptococci.

In chapter 3, we will present the code to run genus level super-pangenomes, essential gene discovery, genus-level essentialome discovery, and analysis on those datasets.

In chapter 4, we will present the code to run comparisons between core and essential genes, as well as the analysis pipelinme for that data.
